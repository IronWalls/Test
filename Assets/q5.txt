A lot of tile counts will be influenced only by memory, so it depends on the target platform for the app.
We can add disabling physics and animations far enough from the player. 2-3h;
Save the level it's also not a problem. 3-4h;
But the project has a lot of singletons and a lot of dirty code with comments. If this application evolves I'll take 8h to refactor it.
