{
    // list of tasks (dunno if you wanted actual <List>)
    // I will probably suggest more if was working longer with it, but heres what i can say from the top of my head
    // 1). i would suggest to check project and to change all calls using invokes and maybe use corutines instead - 2 hours maybe
    // 2). Also in several places i saw usage of:  Find.***.etc...  those things also aren't efficient so worth rewriting 3-4 hours maybe
    // 3). didn't managed to check all systems but the way the level is loaded also i think can be approved - 4+ hours i guess
    //
